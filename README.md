Weather App
This project is a weather forecasting application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for weather conditions in a specific location and displays the current weather along with options to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Features
Location Search: Users can input a location to get the current weather conditions.
Temperature Unit Toggle: Toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature display.
Dynamic UI: The app changes its background or displays weather-related images/GIFs based on the weather conditions (integrated with the Giphy API).
Weather Data: Fetches real-time weather data from the Visual Crossing API.


Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the web app.
CSS: Styling the layout, colors, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Handling logic for fetching and displaying weather data.
Visual Crossing API: For obtaining weather data.


How It Works
User Input: Enter the name of a city or location.
Fetch Data: The app fetches weather data from the Visual Crossing API.
Display Data: Shows temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy), and an option to toggle temperature units.
